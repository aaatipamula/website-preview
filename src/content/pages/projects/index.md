# Projects 

## CD-Server [Link](https://github.com/aaatipamula/cd-server)

I designed this to help me contiously deploy my personal projects with *Docker*. This utilizes a lot of the knowledge I've aquired about web APIs including *authentication*, *HTTP methods*, and *deploying* a web API. There is a web interface that also helps me manage my dockerized projects when I don't have direct access to the server they are running on.


## AnikethAI [Link](https://github.com/aaatipamula/anikethAI)

This is a *Discord bot* that imitates my speech using *ChatGPT*. The inital idea came from a summer internship I did where I had to create a proof of concept application that integrated a company's data with LLM AI. I did a lot of R&D for the project and decided to make a personal project that showcased my newfound knowledge of LLM AI. 

This is also where I learned a lot about good programing practices and reading documentation for frameworks. As a result, the code quality and effective usage of the framework has improved in this project as compared to previous ones.

## The Butterfly Keyboard [Link](https://github.com/aaatipamula/butterfly)

This is a keyboard I designed out of my interest in [Custom Mechanical Keyboards](/interests/computers#custom-kechanical-keyboards). This was a pretty big learning curve for me as I had to learn about different types of *microcontrollers*, conventional *keyboard design* with microcontrollers, and *PCB design*. However I feel like the payoff was immensely satisfying. 

The board I designed is pretty crude and only includes the bare minimum for a functioning keyboard but I learned a lot about *embedded systems* and *PCB design* throughout this project. I am planning on either redesigning the board or even desiging something completely different!
