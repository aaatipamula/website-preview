# Navigation

**This is a website that is easily navigable with a keyboard!**

You can type `/` to focus the command bar and type a path to navigate to a page on this website. 

If you type `/` and don't enter a path it will toggle this page overlay.

`Tab` can also be used to quickly focus the command bar.

`Esc` exits this page, and if you are focused on the command bar it also clears input and unfocuses it!

If you are on *mobile* you can still click links and buttons like normal!

> TIP: Use `:tt` to quickly toggle the theme!

# Fun Facts

The keyboard you see is actually a reflection of my split keyboard layout! As you press the keys the corresponding keys for my specific keymap will be shown :)

This site is statically generated using **Jekyll, TailwindCSS, and htmx**
